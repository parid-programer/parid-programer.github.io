                    I was born in Prishtina, Kosovo and I stil live there today, so I am not a native english speaker, but since I was four I learned it.
                    Now, I am a fluent english speaker. I am not fully self-taught in programming in general, but I am self-taught in Python, networking, php, C, C++, Unity,
                    Arduino etc, even though I don't fully know php, C, C++ and Unity

                    I also have a brother, which is way older than me and that also knows programming, primarily in the machine learning field. He also knows a lot of math, 
                    some of it that i don't understand, including calculus.
